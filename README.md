# Quiztime
Hi! Welcome to my Quiz. I am creating this as of October 28th, 2021 but I feel as if this will be updated and more advanced in the coming months and well more devolped in the coming years. I, Christian Diaz, am new to the developing scene and want to work my hardest to devlop new and improved web designs and refractor new code when neeeded. T

My Three main goals for this project:
I wanted to have a well written javascript code.
I sought to have a css and functional html.
Finally, I wanted to have all my files to be in order so that it was a flowing code instead of messy sloppy one.
